= RecordCache

RecordCache is a simple yet powerful extension to ActiveRecord that caches indexes
and ActiveRecord models using MemCache. If you use it correctly, it will drastically
reduce your database load.

== Usage:

  require 'record_cache'

  class User < ActiveRecord
    record_cache :by => :id
    record_cache :id, :by => :username
  end

  # These will use the cache now.
  User.find(1)
  User.find_by_id(2)
  User.find_all_by_username('chuck')

Invalidation is handled for you using callbacks. Be careful though if you modify records
directly using SQL. Both update_all and delete_all handle invalidations for you, but other
direct SQL will not.

== Testing:

  # ensure memcached is installed and in the path

  createdb -Upostgres record_cache_test
  bundle exec rake test TEST_OPTS="--verbose --no-show-detail-immediately"

== Install:

  gem install record_cache

== Dependencies:

* {after_commit}[http://github.com/freelancing-god/after_commit]
* {memcache}[http://github.com/ninjudd/memcache]

RecordCache is confirmed to work with Rails 2.3.9. It does not currently work with Rails 3.
